# Grid-Load-Visualiser
An interactive Python dashboard that simulates and forecasts power grid load using temperature and time-based models. Built with Streamlit and Plotly to help visualise how environmental conditions impact electricity demand over time.

# ⚡ Grid Load Visualiser & Forecaster

A simple yet powerful tool to simulate and forecast electricity load across a power grid based on ambient temperature, time of day, and base system demand. Built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly**, this project demonstrates how environmental and temporal factors influence energy consumption patterns.
